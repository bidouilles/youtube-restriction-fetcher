# YouTube Video Restriction Fetcher üö´üé•

This script is designed to efficiently gather data on regionally restricted YouTube videos. It randomly selects topics, fetches corresponding video IDs, and checks for regional restrictions.

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests pandas coloredlogs configparser
```

### Configuration

1.  **API Key**: Obtain a YouTube Data API key. Place it in `config.ini`:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
API_KEY = Your_API_Key_Here
```

2.  Create `config.ini` in the root directory and insert your API key.

## Usage üöÄ

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python youtube_restriction_fetcher.py
```

## Appendix

To obtain a YouTube Data API key, you need to follow these general steps:

1.  **Google Developers Console**: Visit the Google Developers Console and sign in with your Google account.
2.  **Create a Project**: If you don't already have a project, create one by providing a name for your project.
3.  **Enable YouTube Data API**: Once the project is created, go to the library section and search for the YouTube Data API v3. Enable this API for your project.
4.  **Create Credentials**: After enabling the API, navigate to the credentials page. Choose 'Create credentials' and select 'API key'. This will generate a new API key for you.
5.  **Restrict and Use API Key**: It's a good practice to restrict the API key to specific APIs or web services and to secure it properly. After this, you can use this API key in your application.
